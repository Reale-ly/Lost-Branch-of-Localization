# Disclaimer!
As of August 2023, I am no longer affiliated with the developers of LBoL and these translations are NOT endorsed by the developers in any way. Keep in mind that localization contains a fair bit of subjective elements, so while I do believe this is an improvement, you might think otherwise. If you like them, use them. If not, feel free to ignore it.
