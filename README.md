# Disclaimer!
As of August 2023, I am no longer affiliated with the developers of LBoL. While I believe these translations are better than the current translations, it is still highly subjective. Keep in mind these translations are NOT endorsed by the developers in any way. If you like them, use them. If not, feel free to ignore this.
